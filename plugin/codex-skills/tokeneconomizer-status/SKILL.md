# tokeneconomizer-status

Run this command in the repository's root directory:

```
"${TOKENECONOMIZER_HOME:-$HOME/.tokeneconomizer}/bin/te" --host codex --cwd "$(pwd)" status
```

Show the output verbatim in a code block. Add nothing unless it contains a warning; then explain the warning in one sentence.

The command reads and writes only TokenEconomizer's own state (under `~/.tokeneconomizer`)
and, for `toolprune apply` or `restore`, the project's `.codex/config.toml`; it makes no model
call. If it reports that the launcher does not exist, the plugin has not run in a session yet:
ask the user to start a new Codex session in this repository first.
