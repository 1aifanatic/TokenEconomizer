"""Arms that involve the mechanisms — including the two scaffold integrations.

The `trimech-rtk` / `trimech-repomap` arms live **here, beside `trimech`**, not in
`baselines/arms.py`, because that is what they are: `trimech` with one external tool
co-activated. Filing them under the baselines would make them read as scaffold arms that
happen to have mechanisms, which is backwards — the mechanisms are the subject and the
scaffold is the comparison. They name their scaffold with a string, so this module still
imports nothing from `tokeneconomizer.baselines`.

`baselines/arms.py` holds only the arms that are *purely* an external tool with no
mechanism active (`rtk`, `serena`, `repomap`).
