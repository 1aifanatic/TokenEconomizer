"""The arm registry: every proven arm, mapped to an exact `EconomizerConfig`.

This is the single source of truth. It assembles two tables that live next to the code they
configure:

* `mechanism_arms.py` -- everything the economizer drives: naive, the effort variants, the
  single-mechanism ablations, `trimech`, and the two scaffold **integrations**, which sit
  beside `trimech` because that is what they are.
* `baselines/arms.py`  -- arms that are only an external tool, with no mechanism active.

`experiments/scripts/run_experiment.py` re-exports `ARMS` and `SCAFFOLD_ARMS` from here, so the
driver
remains the entry point the docs point at and every existing import keeps working.

**Importing this module does not pull a baseline's dependencies.** The arm tables name a
scaffold with a string and the harness resolves it lazily, so `import tokeneconomizer` and
`import te_bench.arms` both stay light -- and `tokeneconomizer/__init__.py`
deliberately does not import this module, so the zero-dependency core import is unchanged.
