"""The fleet CPU budget: one cap for every lane's containers, not one per lane.

`TE_SWEBENCH_MAX_CPUS` caps ONE task container, so N concurrent lanes are an N x cap
ceiling -- six lanes at the harness default would reserve 96 cores of a shared host. The
budget is therefore written onto the cgroup that every rootless-docker container scope
shares, where it binds lanes that are ALREADY RUNNING as well as future ones. These tests
drive the shell against a fake cgroup tree, because the thing that can silently go wrong is
writing the cap to the wrong directory -- which looks exactly like success.
